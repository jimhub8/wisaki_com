The PlayStation 4's controller is called the DualShock 4, and is the most drastic redesign of the PlayStation controller since the introduction of the DualShock. It features capacitive touch input, like that of the PS Vita, improved SixAxis motion sensing, a brightly-colored "Light Bar", speaker on the controller, and at 7.4 ounces, the controller weighs less than an ounce more than the Dualshock 3 (6.74 ounces). The Dualshock 4 was originally intended to look similair to the highly acclaimed Xbox 360 controller, but that idea was put to rest in favour of the more classic and Playstation like side to side analog stick placement that Playstation fans are accustomed to. The integrated light bar can emit various colours to personalise your experience and add a new dimension to games. It also helps the PlayStationÂ®Camera track your controller position â€“ allowing you to interact with your virtual surroundings while using PlayStationÂ®VR. Enjoy extra sound effects â€“ straight from the controller â€“ and chat with online friends via a headset, such as the stereo headset included with the ps4â„¢ system. Prepare your dualshockÂ®4 wireless controller just the way you like it â€“ set the speaker volume, disable vibrations, plus adjust the light bar brightness to conserve battery life when not required. You can also choose to communicate data via BluetoothÂ® or by using a USB cable connected to your ps4â„¢. Guide, gesture and draw with the responsive touch pad â€“ now restyled so you can see your light bar colour fromabove as you play. Use the SHARE button to upload your gameplay videos and pictures on social networks. Stream live gameplay to Twitch, YouTube and Dailymotion or edit your recorded gameplay videos and share them on Facebook and Twitter. You can also invite online friends to play your games with you, even if they don't own them with Share Play.
