<h3>5. POSTING AGENTS</h3>
<strong>As used herein, the term "Posting Agent" refers to a third-party agent, service or intermediary that offers to post Content to the Service on behalf of others.

Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access as set forth in these Terms immediately terminates any permission or license granted herein.
